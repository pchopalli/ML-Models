###### Most of the datasets used for the models are from Kaggle or UCI Repository. These notebooks were done either as part of coursework or practice on my own. I have included the notebooks for Machine Learning models and EDA.
+ Project-ML-Kmeans :- Notebook for Kmean clustering model
+ Project-ML-Regression :- Notebook for Linear Regression
+ boston-marathon-eda-git :- Notebook for EDA of Boston Marathon 2019 results
